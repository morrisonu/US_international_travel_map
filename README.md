# US International Travel Map During COVID-19
Urijah Morrison

## Introduction
This interactive web map displays which countries Americans are currently allowed to travel to during the COVID-19 associated international travel shutdown that has been in place since the outbreak of the disease worldwide. Each country contains a pop-up window when clicked that tells you whether or not Americans are allowed to travel there under current conditions. The map uses colored icons that show this as well. This web map is based on an article written by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html) that lists the countries that Americans are currently able to travel to. While there are other requirements barring entry such as a negative COVID test prior to arrival in some countries as well as a required quarentine I kept it simple by just listing whether Americans could travel there or not so that people are able to get an idea of where they can go, prior to researching further details/requirements.  

## Major Functions
